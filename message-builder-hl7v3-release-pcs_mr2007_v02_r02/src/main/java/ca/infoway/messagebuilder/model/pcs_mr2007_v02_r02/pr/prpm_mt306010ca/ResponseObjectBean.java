/**
 * <p>Business Name: Response Object</p>
 * 
 * <p>Supports the business request to be able to specify 
 * expected response to this query</p>
 * 
 * <p>This is an optional output control parameter. Sender 
 * indicates via coded values which class or class attributes 
 * in the response model are to be valued in the response. By 
 * site agreement codes can be based upon local object model, 
 * or alternatively, the classes and attributes from the query 
 * response model, as in the example below. Example: requestor 
 * wants provider identifier, name and service delivery 
 * location data returned so ResponseObject is valued as 
 * follows:</p><p>&lt;ResponseObject&gt;&lt;value 
 * code=&quot;HealthCareProvider.id&quot;/&gt;&lt;/ResponseObject&gt;</p><p>&lt;ResponseObject&gt;&lt;value 
 * code=&quot;PrincipalPerson.name&quot;/&gt;&lt;/ResponseObject&gt;</p><p>&lt;ResponseObject&gt;&lt;value 
 * code=&quot;ServiceDeliveryLocation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/ResponseObject&gt;</p><p>Utilized 
 * to support cases when a source or consumer (such as a Health 
 * Authority) wants only specific information about a given set 
 * of providers. For example, a HA might want to know all the 
 * Work Locations for a given provider type, and wouldn't want 
 * to receive all information. The type of information expected 
 * in the response is provided via the response object.</p>

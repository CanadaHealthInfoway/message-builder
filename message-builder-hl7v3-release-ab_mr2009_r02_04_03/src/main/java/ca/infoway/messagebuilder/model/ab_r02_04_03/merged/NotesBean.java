/**
 * <p>COMT_MT301001CA.Annotation: Comment</p>
 * 
 * <p>Allows comments to be attached to a Patient record. A 
 * Patient record can pertain to demographic or clinical (Drug, 
 * Condition, Lab, DI, etc) information.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Identifies the comments to be recorded against a 
 * Patient's record.</p>
 * 
 * <p>COCT_MT120600CA.Annotation: Notes</p>
 * 
 * <p>Identified-confirmable is used on requests 
 * Identified-information is used on responses</p>
 * 
 * <p>Public Health requires all clinical notes to be 
 * 'verified' by a responsible party if not created by 
 * physician in charge. This model conveys the correct 
 * semantics, but is inconsistent with other uses of 
 * &quot;author&quot; participation in POIZ models. Any changes 
 * here will have to be reconciled with other projects using 
 * this same cmet.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Allows various Providers to attach comments to an 
 * existing record, and thus improving cross-provider 
 * communications.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This is a list of comments made about the record by 
 * providers. Information captured here includes the provider 
 * making the comments; and excludes information that would 
 * render the record invalid. This information will only be 
 * seen when another provider reviews the record. Urgent or 
 * targeted messages should be sent using a different mechanism 
 * (e.g. phone).</p>

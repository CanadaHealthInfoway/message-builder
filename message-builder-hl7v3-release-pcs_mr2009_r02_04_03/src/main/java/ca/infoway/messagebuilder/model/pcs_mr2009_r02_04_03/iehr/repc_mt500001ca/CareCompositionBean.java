/**
 * <p>Business Name: Care Composition</p>
 * 
 * <p>Care compositions allow grouping together numerous 
 * related records which aids searching and navigation. Also, 
 * the mere knowledge that a type of care has occurred or is 
 * occurring (e.g. an in-patient hospital encounter) can be 
 * useful information when delivering subsequent care.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A care composition is a record with two purposes. It 
 * indicates that care of a given type has occurred or is 
 * occurring. It also acts as a collector for the events that 
 * happened during care, including who is responsible for the 
 * care provided.</p><p>Care composition messages may be sent 
 * during the course of care to describe the progress of care 
 * or may be sent at the termination of care to describe all 
 * the activities that occurred during the provision of care. 
 * Note that this record merely captures the existence of care 
 * and the locations and people involved. The actual discrete 
 * events and any care summary documentation that results are 
 * captured using other messages.</p><p>Examples include: 
 * encounters, condition-related care (episodes) and 
 * longer-term care collections such as &quot;gynecological 
 * care&quot;.</p>

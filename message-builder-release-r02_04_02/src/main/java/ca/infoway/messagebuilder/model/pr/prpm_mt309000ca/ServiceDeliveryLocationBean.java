/**
 * <p>Service Delivery Location</p>
 * 
 * <p>A role played by a place at which services may be 
 * provided. The RIM defines two specializations of service 
 * delivery location: 1. incidental service delivery location - 
 * A role played by a place at which health care services may 
 * be provided without prior designation or authorization and 
 * 2. dedicated service delivery location - A role played by a 
 * place that is intended to house the provision of services. 
 * Scoper is the Entity (typically Organization) that provides 
 * these services. This is not synonymous with "ownership". 
 * This can be further characterized by a role code of: 
 * A)DedicatedClinicalLocationRoleType - A role of a place that 
 * further classifies the clinical setting (e.g., cardiology 
 * clinic, primary care clinic, rehabilitation hospital, 
 * skilled nursing facility) in which care is delivered during 
 * an encounter or B)DedicatedNonClinicalLocationRoleType - A 
 * role of a place that further classifies the setting in which 
 * non-clinical services are delivered. A given physical place 
 * can play multiple service delivery location roles each with 
 * its own attributes. For example, a Podiatric clinic and 
 * Research clinic may meet on alternate days in the same 
 * physical location; each clinic uses its own mailing address 
 * and telephone number.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Roleclass required to support the identification of the 
 * physical location where healthcare services are provided</p>

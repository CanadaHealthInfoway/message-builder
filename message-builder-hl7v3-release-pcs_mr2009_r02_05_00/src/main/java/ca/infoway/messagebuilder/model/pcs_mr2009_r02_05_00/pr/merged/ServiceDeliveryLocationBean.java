 * 2. dedicated service delivery location - A role played by a

 * &quot;ownership&quot;. This can be further characterized by 
 * a role code of: A)DedicatedClinicalLocationRoleType - A role 
 * of a place that further classifies the clinical setting 
 * (e.g., cardiology clinic, primary care clinic,

 * care is delivered during an encounter or 
 * B)DedicatedNonClinicalLocationRoleType - A role of a place 
 * that further classifies the setting in which non-clinical 
 * services are delivered. A given physical place can play 
 * multiple service delivery location roles each with its own 
 * attributes. For example, a Podiatric clinic and Research

It is the combined consensus view of information from the perspective of the HL7 working group and the HL7 international affiliates. The RIM is the ultimate source from which all HL7 version 3.0 protocol specification standards draw their information-related content.</p></text></description><usageNotes><text><div title="History of the RIM">    <p>Development of the HL7 RIM began in April 1996. The first release of the RIM was adopted by the HL7 Technical Steering Committee at the January 1997 working group meeting. This release was known as the HL7 draft RIM version 0.80.</p>  <p>The next two working group meetings focused on gaining familiarity with the draft RIM and implementing a process for obtaining and reconciling proposed enhancements to the model. The RIM maintenance process became known as "RIM harmonization." Between 1998 and 2000, there were nine harmonization meetings to consider proposed enhancements to the draft RIM. The meetings culminated in version 1.0 of the HL7 RIM, unveiled at the HL7 working group meeting held in January 2001. The harmonization meetings focused on five major themes:</p>  <ul>  <li>  <b>Ensure coverage of HL7 version 2.x.</b> This set of change proposals introduced content to the draft model to ensure that it included all the information content of HL7 version 2.x.</li>  <li>  <b>Remove unsubstantiated content from the model.</b> This set of change proposals focused on removing content from the draft model that the steward technical committee did not originate and could find no rationale for retaining.</li>  <li>  <b>Unified service action model.</b> This set of change proposals introduced a concise, well-defined set of structures and vocabularies that address the information needs of a wide variety of clinical scenarios. This collection of proposals, know as USAM, involved the combined effort of multiple technical committees.</li>  <li>  <b>Ensure quality.</b> This set of change proposals addressed inconsistencies in the draft model and conflicts between the model and the modeling style guide. It began the practice of recording and tracking open issues in the model.</li>  <li>  <b>Address the "left hand side" of the model.</b> This set of change proposals introduced powerful structures and vocabularies for the non-clinical portions of the model (patient administration, finance, scheduling). Like the unified service action model, this proposal involved the combined effort of multiple technical committees.</li>  </ul>  <p>The harmonization process and themes have produced an HL7 reference information model that is credible, clear, comprehensive, concise, and consistent. Its structure is both flexible and extensible, and its contents can be readily mapped to the HL7 2.x message standard and other widely used healthcare dataset specifications.</p>  <p>This ballot is release 1.22 of the HL7 RIM. It is a model that continues to be fine tuned as technical committees use it for an ever widening scope of work as part of developing a family of HL7 model-driven standards, HL7 version 3.0. The RIM is now remarkably stable and at the same time the harmonization process ensures it will always be relevant and reflective of the information needs of the HL7 standards. </p>  </div><div title="Use of the RIM by HL7">    <p>The HL7 RIM is a critical component of the V3 development process. It is the root of all information models and structures developed as part of the V3 development process.</p>  <p>The HL7 V3 standard development process is a model-driven methodology in which a network of inter-related models are developed that depict the static and behavioral aspects of the requirements and design of HL7 standards, as well as the underlying semantics and business rules that govern them.</p>  <p>The RIM provides a static view of the information needs of HL7 V3 standards. It includes class and state-machine diagrams and is accompanied by use case models, interaction models, data type models, terminology models, and other types of models to provide a complete view of the requirements and design of HL7 standards. The classes, attributes, state-machines, and relationships in the RIM are used to derive domain-specific information models that are then transformed through a series of constraining refinement processes to eventually yield a static model of the information content of an HL7 standard.</p>  <p>The HL7 V3 standard development process defines the rules governing the derivation of domain information models from the RIM and the refinement of those models into HL7 standard specifications. The rules require that all information structures in derived models be traceable back to the RIM and that their semantic and related business rules not conflict with those specified in the RIM. The RIM therefore is the ultimate source for all information content in HL7 V3 standards.</p>  <p>The RIM is used by HL7 international affiliates to extend HL7 V3 standards to meet local needs. Through a process known as localization, V3 standard specifications are extended using the RIM as the source for new information content. This new information is derived from the RIM and refined in the same manner used to create the original specification.</p>  </div><div title="Uses of the RIM Outside of HL7">    <p>The RIM is primarily for use by HL7 and its international affiliates. However, others outside of HL7 have also found the RIM useful. Early adopters of the V3 standards development process have used the RIM to develop HL7-like message specifications in their own environments. These early adopters include vendors, large integrated delivery networks, and government agencies within the United States and internationally. These same early adopters are extremely active in HL7 and provide practical input to the RIM and other aspects of V3 the development process.</p>  <p>Some HL7 member organizations have reported using the RIM as a source of input to their enterprise information architectures or as a starting place for systems analysis and design. The RIM may indeed be useful for such purposes; however, HL7 provides no assurance that the RIM is useful for anything other than as a reference model for HL7 standards development.</p>  <p>The RIM is only one model of healthcare information needs. The abstract style of the RIM and the ability to extend the RIM through vocabulary specifications make the RIM applicable to any conceivable healthcare system information interchange scenario. In fact, it is conceptually applicable to any information domain involving entities playing roles and participating in acts.</p>  <p>The universal applicability of the RIM makes it particularly useful for an organization like HL7 that has to consider the needs of a large and diverse membership. The style of the RIM makes it extremely stable, which is another important characteristic for HL7. The HL7 standards development process calls for the creation of domain specific models derived from the RIM and the incremental refinement of those models into design models that are specific to the problem area. These problem area specific design models narrow the abstractness of the RIM and include constraints on attribute values and class relationships that are use case specific. External organizations considering using the HL7 RIM are advised to adopt a similar process of deriving design models as a transformation of the RIM.</p>  </div></text></usageNotes><walkthrough><text>    <p>The RIM uses a very abstract modeling style. The back-bone classes of the RIM and their structural attributes are its core. An understanding of these classes and attributes are essential to understanding the RIM.</p>  <div title="RIM as an abstract model">    <p>The RIM is comprised of six "back-bone" classes:</p>  <ul>  <li>  <classRef root="DEFN" realm="Universal" artifact="RIM" className="Act"/> which represents the actions that are executed and must be documented as health care is managed and provided;</li>  <li>  <classRef root="DEFN" realm="Universal" artifact="RIM" className="Participation"/> which expresses the context for an act in terms such as who performed it, for whom it was done, where it was done, etc.;</li>  <li>  <classRef root="DEFN" realm="Universal" artifact="RIM" className="Entity"/> which represents the physical things and beings that are of interest to, and take part in health care;</li>  <li>  <classRef root="DEFN" realm="Universal" artifact="RIM" className="Role"/> which establishes the roles that entities play as they participate in health care acts;</li>  <li>  <classRef root="DEFN" realm="Universal" artifact="RIM" className="ActRelationship"/> which represents the binding of one act to another, such as the relationship between an order for an observation and the observation event as it occurs; and</li>  <li>  <classRef root="DEFN" realm="Universal" artifact="RIM" className="RoleLink"/> which represents relationships between individual roles.</li>  </ul>  <p>Three of these classes -- Act, Entity and Role -- are further represented by a set of specialized classes, or sub-types. In the HL7 representation, a sub-type is only added to the RIM if it requires one or more attributes or associations that are not inherited from its parents. Classes that represent distinct concepts, but which need no further attributes or associations are represented solely as a unique code in the controlling vocabulary. Therefore, these three classes include the following coded attributes, which serve to further define the concept being modeled:</p>  <ul>  <li>  <b>classCode </b>(in Act, Entity and Role) represents the exact class or concept intended, whether or not that class is represented as a class in the RIM hierarchy;</li>  <li>  <b>moodCode </b>(in Act) and <b>determinerCode </b>(in Entity) an attribute that distinguishes whether the class represents an instance or a kind of Act or Entity. If the class is a specialization of Act then moodCode further delineates the instance as an occurrence or an intent;</li>  <li>  <b>code </b>(in Act, Entity and Role) provides for further classification within a particular classCode value, such as a particular type of observation within the Observation class. </li>  </ul>  <p>The other three RIM back-bone classes -- Participation, ActRelationship and RoleLink -- are not represented by generalization-specialization hierarchies. Nevertheless, these classes represent a variety of concepts, such as different forms of participation or different kinds of relationships between acts. These distinctions are represented by a <b>typeCode </b>attribute that is asserted for each of these classes.</p>  </div>  <div title="Representation of RIM class structure">    <p>As noted previously, the RIM is modeled using a subset of the semantics embodied in UML. The RIM is a set of UML classes, each containing one or more attributes, which are assigned a data type based on an independent specification of Version 3 data types. The classes are linked either by a set of association relationships, identified by unique role names, or by generalization relationships.</p>  <p>Each of these elements includes a textual definition. The appearance of attributes and associations is controlled by cardinality and related constraints applied to the attributes and to the roles that link the associations to the classes. </p>  </div>  <div title="Representation of controlling vocabulary">    <p>Several of the attributes in the RIM are coded with the CS data type, which means that the value set to be used for those attributes must be drawn from the set of codes that have been defined by HL7. The classCode and typeCode attributes mentioned above are examples of attributes with a CS data type.</p>  <p>All of the code sets for these attributes are included as part of this ballot and are subject to the same voting principles as the classes in the RIM. Each code set is represented as a vocabulary domain -- the set of all concepts that can be taken as valid values in an instance of a coded field or attribute. It is important to note that a vocabulary domain consists of a set of concepts, not a set of words or codes.</p>  </div>  <div title="Related specifications">    <p>As noted above, each attribute in the RIM is assigned a data type. The formal specification for these data types is embodied in the normative specification "<externalRef ref="http://datatypes-its-xml.htm#" alt="HL7 V3 Data Types Implementable Technology Specification for XML"/>" and the informative document "<externalRef ref="http://datatypes.htm#" alt="Data Types Abstract Specification"/>", both of which are currently being balloted by HL7. A table that abstracts the definition of the data types used in the RIM is included in this ballot as Appendix B.</p>  </div>  </text></walkthrough><otherAnnotation type="Implications of Balloting the RIM"><text>    <p>Balloting the RIM establishes it as more than just an internal HL7 artifact. As a balloted standard the RIM will be advanced as an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard and perhaps as an ISO standard. Other ANSI or ISO accredited standards organizations such as X12 and CEN-TC251 (European Standardization of Health Informatics) have expressed interest in using or referencing the RIM in their own standards development work. Establishing the RIM as a standard makes its use by other standards development organizations (SDO) much easier. The potential for tremendous benefits exists by having a common reference information model used across multiple healthcare SDOs.</p>  <p>A balloted RIM is also important to meet the local standards needs of HL7 International Affiliates. In order for the affiliates to apply localized extensions to HL7 standards according to the HL7 V3 standard development process, the RIM itself must be a standard. This is often mandated by local geopolitical jurisdictions, e.g., to ensure that local standards are extensions of already approved general standards.</p>  <p>Federal, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States are encouraged to consider accredited national standards when conducting initiatives in which the standards are applicable. As a standard for information content of HL7 interoperability standards, U.S. governmental agencies will need to consider the applicability of the RIM when establishing health care systems interoperability solutions.</p>  <div title="Normative Portions of the RIM">    <p>The RIM consists of classes assigned to one or more subject area packages. Attributes, Relationships, and State Machines are associated with classes. Only the classes included in the NormativeContent subject area and their associated attributes, relationships, and state machines are normative. Relationships between normative and non-normative classes are non-normative.</p>  <p>The RIM is expressed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) with HL7 specific tags as extensions to the UML model element metadata. All standard UML model element metadata values are normative but only the following HL7 extensions are also normative:</p>  <ul>  <li>Class.stateAttribute</li>  <li>Class.classCode</li>  <li>Attribute.mandatoryInclusion</li>  <li>Attribute.cardinality</li>  <li>Attribute.vocabDomain</li>  <li>Attribute.vocabStrength</li>  </ul>  <p>The remaining HL7 extensions are for administrative use only and are not part of the normative RIM specification.</p>  </div>  <div title="Normative References">    <p>The V3 Data type specifications (<externalRef ref="http://datatypes.htm#" alt="Data Types Abstract Specification"/> and <externalRef ref="http://datatypes-its-xml.htm#" alt="V3 Data Types Implementable Technology Specification for XML"/>) are related normative standards that are balloted independent of the RIM. The <externalRef ref="http://vocabulary.htm#" alt="HL7 Vocabulary Domain"/> specification is an informative reference that includes a variety of tables and terminology references that are cited as domains by various RIM attributes. The vocabulary specifications for what are termed "structural attributes" are part of the normative RIM ballot because they are fundamental to the proper representation of health information using the RIM. A list of these normative tables and hyperlinks to them are provided <divRef id="sbj-rimdiv">at the end of this introduction</divRef>.</p>  </div>  <div title="Meaning of Normative">    <p>The normative portions of the RIM are the only portions subject to ballot and are the only portions for which conformance rules are defined. Substantive changes to normative RIM model elements require a re-ballot of the RIM. When re-balloting the RIM only the substantive changes are subject to ballot. The following changes to the RIM are not considered substantive:</p>  <ul>  <li>Changes to descriptive text for model elements that does not materially alter the semantics of the model element;</li>  <li>Changes to class package assignments other than additions or deletions from the NormativeContent subject area;</li>  <li>Changes in package hierarchies or names;</li>  <li>Changes to class diagram layouts;</li>  <li>Changes to model elements outside the NormativeContent subject area package.</li>  </ul>  </div>  </text></otherAnnotation><otherAnnotation type="Normative structural vocabulary for the RIM"><text>    <p>The HL7 vocabulary domains are detailed in a separate document. A selected sub-set of these tables is part of the normative RIM specification. These are the tables for the structural attributes (those with data type of "CS") in the normative classes.

It is not meant to be an "application guide" on RIM usage although several partial examples of usage are presented when they are deemed helpful in explaining the fundamental design and development concepts of the RIM.</p>  </div><div title="Overview">    <p>A Reference Information Model (RIM) is constructed to facilitate consistent sharing and usage of data across multiple "local" contexts. In general, the broader the scope of interest, the more important it is to make explicit all assumptions about a topic or domain-of-interest. The HL7 Version 3 RIM is designed to provide a unified framework for, and to serve as a comprehensive source of, all information used by an HL7 Specification. The RIM specifically and unambiguously articulates both the explicit definitions of healthcare concepts - the "things of interest" to the world of healthcare information systems - and the relationships (aka "associations") between these concepts-of-interest.</p>  <p>HL7 V3 Specifications (e.g. HL7 V3 messages, structured documents, etc.) permit loosely-coupled information systems to interoperate (i.e. exchange data) in a variety of healthcare delivery contexts including those found in disparate provider organizations, perspectives, and jurisdictions. The scope of the HL7 RIM therefore includes all of the information that is required to be sent between, and processed by, participating healthcare information systems. In addition, it should be noted that the RIM does not model (nor need to model) information stored by a given healthcare information system but never transmitted to another system. </p>  <p>The RIM is expressed using a visual modeling syntax based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML). (Specific variances between "standard UML" and "HL7 UML" as manifest in the RIM, such as the placement of association names, are currently under review by the HL7 Modeling and Methodology Technical Committee with the goal of moving to a maximum alignment between the two syntaxes.) HL7 also maintains a database ("RIM repository") containing the details of each RIM concept, attribute, and association including the item's rationale, definition, constraints, and edit/change history. At some point in the future, any or all of this information may be formally published in an HL7-specific UML profile. </p>  <p>It is important to note that the RIM is not intended to be a logical or physical model of a database, a design for a particular vendor's information system, or a perspective focused on a particular healthcare organization or enterprise. In fact, the RIM is not intended to represent a particular set of HL7 messages, but rather the collective universe of data and relationships from which any relevant HL7 message could be constructed. Specific users of the RIM are expected to utilize relevant portions of the RIM as needed, adopting its content to their own information modeling needs and notations. </p>  </div><div title="The Rationale Behind the RIM's Design">    <p>The overarching structure of the RIM is based on six "core" classes: Act, Entity, Role, Participation, ActRelationship, and RoleLink. Each class is defined in Section 1.4. Following is a discussion of the fundamental thinking behind, and basic usage guidelines for, the six classes and their inter-relationships.</p>  <p>The HL7 RIM identifies two major "high-level" concepts that are fundamental to understanding the world of healthcare information: intentional "actions" or "services" (Acts), and "people, places and things" that are of interest in the world of healthcare (Entities).</p>  <p>The concept "Act" (and its subclasses) represents all of the intentional actions documented by a healthcare professional in either a clinical or administrative context. The presence of the Act class as one of the core RIM classes is a reflection of HL7's view that "from a messaging/system communication perspective, healthcare consists of a series of attributed, intentional actions. Thus, instances of the class/concept Act include both clinical observations (e.g. patient temperature) and interventions (e.g. administer medication), and administrative actions (e.g. admit patient). Note that in this "act-centered" view of healthcare, the act of an observation takes on two seemingly contradictory meanings: "the act of recognizing and documenting a particular fact," and "the description of the thing observed." In other words, an instance of an Observation Act represents both the attributed act of observing and the results of the observation. Both aspects of this expanded definition of an Observation Act are captured by specific attributes of the class Act or its subclass Observation.</p>  <p>The concept "Entity" (and its subclasses) includes all living subjects (e.g. persons, animals), organizations (e.g. formal and informal), materials (e.g. durable and non-durable goods, food, tissue, containers,), and places that may be of interest in a healthcare messaging context. It should be noted that the concept of "collection of information" (e.g. a medical record) is <b>not </b> a instance or subclass of Entity, but is instead considered as a collection of attributed Acts.</p>  <p>The RIM places two additional classes - Role and Participation - between Act and Entity. The Role class models several important concepts that are prevalent in the healthcare delivery domain. First, Role captures the fact that the various "static" entities may "temporally" assume one or more "roles" (e.g. patient, primary care physician, responsible party, Registered Nurse etc.) in a particular healthcare context. Second, the concepts of "capability" (e.g. Advanced Cardiac Life Support) and "certification" (e.g. Licensed Practical Nurse) are also modeled using instances of the Role class. Finally, careful examination of the multiplicity (0..1) and names (scoper, player) of the <b>two</b> associations between Entity and Role reveals that the Role class can be used to "group" instances of Entity.</p>  <p>It is important to distinguish the concept of Entity-in-a-Role from the Act-specific concept of "the function-based role played by an Entity-in-a-Role in the context of a specific Act." These semantics are modeled using instances of the Participation class. For example, an Anesthesia Resident (Entity-in-a-Role) administers anesthesia (Participation as "provider" in the Act "administer anesthesia") to a patient (Participation as a 'recipient" in the Act "administer anesthesia." <b>Note that the absence of a direct association between the Participation and Entity classes is a manifestation of an underlying HL7 RIM assumption that all instances of Entity involved in an Act are participating in the Act in a particular Role.</b>  </p>  <p>In summary, both the Participation and the Role classes are necessary to fully model the complex semantics that exist between instances of Entity and Act, and a concise summary of the HL7 RIM's view of healthcare can be stated as follows: <b>At the highest level of abstraction, healthcare consists of a series of intentional, attributed Acts performed to, by, on behalf of, utilizing or in some way involving one or more instances of a Participating ("as primary provider," etc.) Entity-in-a-Role ("John Smith in the role of Patient"). </b>  </p>  <p>The two remaining classes in the RIM - ActRelationship and RoleLink - are used to "associate" or "link" instances of the class with which it is associated. The class RoleLink is used to establish a "dependency-based link" (e.g. accountability, chain-of-trust, etc.) between <b>two </b>instances of an Entity-in-a-Role. The semantics of ActRelationship are explained below.</p>  </div><div title="Linking Acts Together: The Semantics of ActRelationship">    <p>An understanding of the semantics and application of ActRelationship begins with, an understanding of the "fractal" or "robotic arm" nature of a set of Acts. This perspective is, in turn, best viewed from the overarching framework of the categorization of three types of "collecting relationships" represented by instances of ActRelationship: whole/part (e.g. lab or test batteries (see the discussion of the "robotic arm" below); rule-based (e.g. care plans, protocols, etc.); and cognitive actions (e.g. judgment, renaming, replacement, subsumption, supported by/reason for, etc.).</p>  <p>Regarding the "fractal" or "robotic arm" discussion, As mentioned above, instances of ActRelationship can be used to model the "fractal" or "robotic arm" notion behind a "whole/part" relationship. Consider a surgical procedure such as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The procedure may be represented as a single instance of Act, or, alternatively, as a "collection" of (partially ordered) instances of Act each of which is a finer granularity than the entire procedure, e.g. obtain consent, administer pre-op medication, administer anesthesia (throughout the surgical procedure), make the incision, etc. In turn, for any of the more finely granulated actions just mentioned, further granulation/decomposition may occur. The degree of granularity is clearly dependent on the context of the action(s) and the interest level/perspective of the party performing (or not performing) the decomposition. Figure 1 shows a "surgeon's-eye view" of some of the instances of Act and ActRelationship for the exemplar cholecystectomy..</p>  <p>  <figure><fixedImage><pixmap href="./Graphics/RIM_IntroFig1.gif"/></fixedImage><caption>Example of sequential plan construction for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Edged boxes are Act instances (all in definition, or 'master' mood.)  Rounded boxes are ActRelationship instances of type: has-component.  The sequenceNumber attribute orders the relationships into a sequence.  Each act can in turn be decomposed into plan-components.</caption></figure>  </p>  <p>In summary, the classes Act and ActRelationship have been designed to allow for representing the rich semantics of each of three types of collections mentioned above at whatever coarseness or fineness of granularity is appropriate to the specific messaging context. In addition, the various of types of collections and levels of granularity represented by instances of ActRelationship can (and will) be expected to be used to collectively capture the complex semantics of clinical reasoning, e.g. an instance of ActRelationship (e.g. "supported by") could be used to form a link from an instance of an observation Act representing a specific lab test (e.g. sedimentation rate = 48 to an instance of an observation Act representing a particular diagnosis (e.g. DX = Systemic Lupus Erythematosus).</p>  </div><div title="Definitions of the Six Core Rim Classes">    <div title="Act">    <p>An <classRef root="DEFN" realm="Universal" artifact="RIM" className="Act"/> is an action of interest that has happened, can happen, is happening, is intended to happen, or is requested/demanded to happen. An act is an intentional action in the business domain of HL7. Healthcare (and any profession or business) is constituted of intentional actions. An Act instance is a record of such an intentional action. </p>  </div>  <div title="Entity">    <p>An <classRef root="DEFN" realm="Universal" artifact="RIM" className="Entity"/> is a class or specific instance of a physical thing or an organization/group of physical things capable of participating in Acts; an artifact. This includes living subjects, organizations, material, and places. The Entity hierarchy encompasses human beings, organizations, living organisms, devices, pharmaceutical substances, etc. It does not include events/acts/actions, the definition of things, or the roles that things can play (e.g. patient, provider). </p>  </div>  <div title="Role">    <p>A <classRef root="DEFN" realm="Universal" artifact="RIM" className="Role"/> is a categorization of competency of the Entity that plays the Role as defined by the Entity that scopes the Role.</p>  <p>An Entity, in a particular Role, can participate in an Act. Note that a particular entity in a particular role can participate in an act in many ways. Thus, a Person in the role of a practitioner can participate in a patient encounter as a rounding physician or as an attending physician. The Role defines the competency of the Entity irrespective of any Act, as opposed to Participation, which is limited to the scope of an Act.</p>  <p>Each role is 'played' by one Entity (the Entity that is in the role) and is usually 'scoped' by another. Thus the Role of 'patient' is played by (usually) a person and scoped by the provider from whom the patient will receive services. Similarly, the employer scopes an Employee role. </p>  </div>  <div title="Participation">    <p>A <classRef root="DEFN" realm="Universal" artifact="RIM" className="Participation"/> is an association between a Role and an Act. The Participation represents the involvement of the Entity playing the Role with regard to the associated Act. A single Role may participate in multiple Acts and a single Act may have multiple participating Roles. A single Participation is always an association between a particular Role and a particular Act. Participation is limited to the scope of the Act, as opposed to Role, which defines the competency of an Entity irrespective of any Act.</p>  </div>  <div title="ActRelationship">    <p>An <classRef root="DEFN" realm="Universal" artifact="RIM" className="ActRelationship"/> is an association between a pair of Acts. This includes Act to Act associations such as collector/component, predecessor/successor, and cause/outcome.</p>  <p> The class has two associations to the Act class, one named "source" the other named "target". .... Since the relationships associated with an Act are considered properties of the source act object. That means that the originator of the information reported in an act object is not only responsible for the attribute values of that object, but also for all its outgoing relationships.</p>  <p> The rule of attribution is that all act relationships are attributed to the responsible actor of the Act at the source of the ActRelationship (the "source act".) </p>  </div>  <div title="RoleLink">    <p>A <classRef root="DEFN" realm="Universal" artifact="RIM" className="RoleLink"/> is a connection between two roles expressing a dependency between those roles. </p>  </div>  <div title="Sub Classes of Act, Entity and Role">    <p>Entity, Act and Role are "high-level" classes, although they are not "abstract" classes in the formal sense (i.e. meaningful instances of both classes are quite common). As a result, it has been necessary to define a number of more specialized subclasses of these three classes to specify the additional data (class attributes) required in more specific contexts (e.g. the Observation subclass of Act and the Living Subject and Material subclasses of Entity). Attributes of a subclass must be both useful and unique to that subclass. Subclasses inherit all of the attributes of their parent superclass.</p>  <p>There are meaningful subclasses in each of these hierarchies that do not require additional attributes, and therefore are not represented as classes in the RIM. The "classCode" attribute in each of these hierarchies specifies which class is represented. The code set that can be used with the "classCode" attributes are tightly controlled by HL7. A second attribute in each hierarchy, the "code" attribute provides a further classification of subtypes of each subclass.</p>  </div>  <div title="The Concept of Mood">    <p>The Act class represents intentional actions. These actions can exist in different "moods". Moods describe activities as they progress in the business cycle, from defined, through planned and ordered to complete. The mood of an Act is specified by the value of the Act.moodCode attribute.</p>  <p> Any instance of an Act assumes one and only one mood and will not change its mood along its life cycle. The moods - definition, intent, order, event - seem to specify a life cycle of an activity. However, the participants in the activity in these different moods are different, as is the data. Therefore, the mood of an Act instance is static. The progression actualization (i.e., the progression from defined, through planned and ordered, to being performed) is called the "business cycle" to distinguish it from the "life cycle" of a single act instance. Related Act instances that form such a "business cycle" are linked through the ActRelationship class. </p>  </div>  </div><div title="Data Type and Vocabulary Specifications">    <p>The RIM class, attribute and association definitions provide detail about logical meaning, but a full specification requires data type and vocabulary specifications. <b>Data Types</b> define the allowable values of attributes and what these values "mean." Data types are therefore the fundamental building blocks that shape (and constrain) all the semantics that can ultimately expressed in the RIM. For HL7 Version 3, the datatype specifications are found in the <externalRef ref="http://datatypes.htm#" alt="Data Types Abstract Specification"/> and in the <externalRef ref="http://datatypes-its-xml.htm#" alt="V3 Data Types Implementable Technology Specification for XML"/> A summary of the data types is also provided in Appendix B.</p>  <p>Vocabulary specifications for attributes include the assignment of a default domain, and a "coding strength." <b>Vocabulary Domains</b> are explicitly defined in <externalRef ref="http://vocabulary.htm#" alt="Vocabulary Domains"/>. They document cross-reference and alternative representations among coding systems, while keeping track of the logical concepts being expressed by each code. Each coded attribute may only be expressed using specific Vocabulary Domains.</p>  <p>  <b>Coding strength</b> is a coded property of an attribute that states whether or not a user of the HL7 Version 3 standard may communicate a coded value that is not part of the defined domain. Such a value is termed an "exception" to the domain. Coding strength may have one of two values. <b>Coded with Exceptions (CWE) </b> allows the end user to send a term from a local coding system in place of a term from the formal domain. <b>Coded , No Exceptions (CNE) </b> states that communication instances may only contain codes that are in the domain that constrains the attribute.</p>  </div><div title="HL7 Version 3 Methodology and the RIM">    <p>In summary, the primary motivation for the development of the RIM was the desire to clearly define the various data elements and relationships that comprise the healthcare information space. A direct outgrowth of this knowledge explication exercise is the ability to reuse the same concept in multiple healthcare messages. The complete process of defining a message is defined and discussed in the V3 Guide and accompanying HL7 Message Definition Framework (MDF). The basic steps include definition and documentation of the data interchange needs (e.g. a set of messages to support a particular clinical or administrative process) via a Storyboard, the selection/restriction of the RIM to those classes and attributes needed to populate the given message, and the subsequent application of additional constraints on number and possible values of each attribute. </p>  <p>Refer to the HL7 Version 3 Guide and MDF for further information.</p>  </div></text></appendix><appendix name="B" title="Summary of Version 3 Data Types"><text><div title="Overview of Data Types">    <p>The following table summarizes the definition of each of the data types being balloted as part of HL7 Version 3, as of December 2, 2002.

been done, can be done, or is intended or requested to be done.</p><p><i>Examples:</i> The kinds of acts that are common in health care are (1) a clinical observation, (2) an assessment of health condition (such as problems and diagnoses), (3) healthcare goals, (4) treatment services (such as medication, surgery, physical and psychological therapy), (5) assisting, monitoring or attending, (6) training and education services to patients and their next of kin, (7) and notary services (such as advanced directives or living will), (8) editing and maintaining documents, and many others.</p><p><i>Discussion and Rationale:</i> Acts are the pivot of the RIM; all domain information and processes are represented primarily in Acts. Any profession or business, including healthcare, is primarily constituted of intentional actions, performed and recorded by responsible actors. An Act-instance is a record of such an intentional action. Intentional actions are distinguished from something that happens by forces of nature (natural events). Such natural events are not Acts by themselves, but may be recorded as observed (Observation).</p><p>Acts connect to Entities in their Roles through Participations and connect to other Acts through ActRelationships. Participations are the authors, performers and other responsible parties as well as subjects and beneficiaries (which includes tools and material used in the performance of the act, which are also subjects). The moodCode distinguishes between Acts that are meant as factual records, vs. records of intended or ordered services, and the other modalities in which act can appear.</p><p>One of the Participations that all acts have (at least implicitly) is a primary author, who is responsible of the Act and who "owns" the act. Responsibility for the act means responsibility for what is being stated in the Act and as what it is stated. Ownership of the act is assumed in the sense of who may operationally modify the same act. Ownership and responsibility of the Act is not the same as ownership or responsibility of what the Act-object refers to in the real world. The same real world activity can be described by two people, each being the author of their Act, describing the same real world activity. Yet one can be a witness while the other can be a principal performer. The performer has responsibilities for the physical actions; the witness only has responsibility for making a true statement to the best of his or her ability. The two Act-instances may even disagree, but because each is properly attributed to its author, such disagreements can exist side by side and left to arbitration by a recipient of these Act-instances.</p><p>In this sense, an Act-instance represents a "statement" according to Rector and Nowlan (1991) [Foundations for an electronic medical record. Methods Inf Med. 30.] Rector and Nowlan have emphasized the importance of understanding the medical record not as a collection of facts, but "a faithful record of what clinicians have heard, seen, thought, and done." Rector and Nowlan go on saying that "the other requirements for a medical record, e.g., that it be attributable and permanent, follow naturally from this view." Indeed the Act class is this attributable statement, and the rules of updating acts (discussed in the state-transition model, see Act.statusCode) versus generating new Act-instances are designed according to this principle of permanent attributable statements.</p><p>Rector and Nolan focus on the electronic medical record as a collection of statements, while attributed statements, these are still mostly factual statements. However, the Act class goes beyond this limitation to attributed factual statements, representing what is known as "speech-acts" in linguistics and philosophy. The notion of speech-act includes that there is pragmatic meaning in language utterances, aside from just factual statements; and that these utterances interact with the real world to change the state of affairs, even directly cause physical activities to happen. For example, an order is a speech act that (provided it is issued adequately) will cause the ordered action to be physically performed. The speech act theory has culminated in the seminal work by Austin (1962) [How to do things with words. Oxford University Press].</p><p>An activity in the real world may progress from defined, through planned and ordered to executed, which is represented as the mood of the Act. Even though one might think of a single activity as progressing from planned to executed, this progression is reflected by multiple Act-instances, each having one and only one mood that will not change along the Act-instance's life cycle. This is because the attribution and content of speech acts along this progression of an activity may be different, and it is often critical that a permanent and faithful record be maintained of this progression. The specification of orders or promises or plans must not be overwritten by the specification of what was actually done, so as to allow comparing actions with their earlier specifications. Act-instances that describe this progression of the same real world activity are linked through the ActRelationships (of the relationship category "sequel").</p><p>Act as statements or speech-acts are the only representation of real world facts or processes in the HL7 RIM. The truth about the real world is constructed through a combination (and arbitration) of such attributed statements only, and there is no class in the RIM whose objects represent "objective state of affairs" or "real processes" independent from attributed statements. As such, there is no distinction between an activity and its documentation. Every Act includes both to varying degrees. For example, a factual statement made about recent (but past) activities, authored (and signed) by the performer of such activities, is commonly known as a procedure report or original documentations (e.g., surgical procedure report, clinic note etc.). Conversely, a status update on an activity that is presently in progress, authored by the performer (or a close observer) is considered to capture that activity (and is later superceded by a full procedure report). However, both status update and procedure report are acts of the same kind, only distinguished by mood and state (see statusCode) and completeness of the information.</p></text></definition></annotations><behavior supplierStateAttributeName="statusCode"><figure><fixedImage><pixmap href="./Graphics/RIM_ActStatus.gif"/></fixedImage></figure><subState name="aborted" parentStateName="normal"><annotations><definition><text><p>The Act has been terminated prior to the originally intended completion.</p></text></definition></annotations></subState><subState name="active" parentStateName="normal"><annotations><definition><text><p>The Act can be performed or is being performed.</p></text></definition></annotations></subState><subState name="cancelled" parentStateName="normal"><annotations><definition><text><p>The Act has been abandoned before activation.</p></text></definition></annotations></subState><subState name="completed" parentStateName="normal"><annotations><definition><text><p>An Act that has terminated normally after all of its constituents have been performed.</p></text></definition></annotations></subState><subState name="held" parentStateName="normal"><annotations><definition><text><p>An Act that is still in the preparatory stages has been put aside.

Mood is not state.</p><p>To describe the progression of a business activity from defined to planned to executed, etc. one must instantiate different Act-instances in the different moods and link them using ActRelationship of general type "sequel". (See ActRelationship.typeCode.)</p><p><i>Discussion:</i> The Act.moodCode includes the following notions: (1) event, i.e., factual description of an actions that occurred; (2) definition of possible actions and action plans (the master file layer); (3) intent, i.e., an action plan instantiated for a patient as a care plan or order; (4) goal, i.e., an desired outcome attached to patient problems and plans; and (5) criterion, i.e., a predicate used to evaluate a logical expression.</p><p>The Act.moodCode modifies the meaning of the Act class in a controlled way, just as in natural language, grammatical form of a verb modify the meaning of a sentence in defined ways. For example, if the mood is factual (event), then the entire act object represents a known fact. If the mood expresses a plan (intent), the entire act object represents the expectation of what should be done. The mood does not change the meaning of individual act properties in peculiar ways.</p><p>Since the mood code is a determining factor for the meaning of an entire Act object, the mood must always be known. This means, whenever an act object is instantiated, the mood attribute must be assigned to a valid code, and the mood assignment cannot change throughout the lifetime of an act object.</p><p>As the meaning of an act object is factored in the mood code, the mood code affects the interpretation of the entire Act object and with it every property (attributes and associations). Note that the mood code affects the interpretation of the act object, and the meaning of the act object in turn determines the meaning of the attributes. However, the mood code does not arbitrarily change the meaning of individual attributes.</p><p><i>Inert vs. descriptive properties of Acts:</i> Acts have two kinds of act properties, inert and descriptive properties. Inert properties are not affected by the mood, descriptive properties follow the mood of the object. For example, there is an identifier attribute Act.id, which gives a unique identification to an act object. Being a unique identifier for the object is in no way dependent on the mood of the act object. Therefore, the "interpretation" of the Act.id attribute is inert with respect to the act object's mood.</p><p>By contrast, most of the Act class' attributes are descriptive for what the Act statement expresses. Descriptive properties of the Act class give answer to the questions who, whom, where, with what, how and when the action is done. The questions who, whom, with what, and where are answered by Participations, while how and when are answered by descriptive attributes and ActRelationships. The interpretation of a descriptive attribute is aligned to the interpretation of the entire act object, and controlled by the mood. </p><p><i>Examples:</i> To illustrate the effect of mood code, consider a "blood glucose" observation:</p><p>The DEFINITION mood specifies the Act of "obtaining blood glucose". Participations describe in general the characteristics of the people who must be involved in the act, and the required objects, e.g., specimen, facility, equipment, etc. involved. The Observation.value specifies the absolute domain (range) of the observation (e.g., 15-500 mg/dl).</p><p>In INTENT mood the author of the intent expresses the intent that he or someone else "should obtain blood glucose". The participations are the people actually or supposedly involved in the intended act, especially the author of the intent or any individual assignments for group intents, and the objects actually or supposedly involved in the act (e.g., specimen sent, equipment requirements, etc.). The Observation.value is usually not specified, since the intent is to measure blood glucose, not to measure blood glucose in a specific range. (But compare with GOAL below).</p><p>In REQUEST mood, a kind of intent, the author requests to "please obtain blood glucose". The Participations are the people actually and supposedly involved in the act, especially the placer and the designated filler, and the objects actually or supposedly involved in the act (e.g., specimen sent, equipment requirements, etc.). The Observation.value is usually not specified, since the order is not to measure blood glucose in a specific range.</p><p>In EVENT mood, the author states that "blood glucose was obtained". Participations are the people actually involved in the act, and the objects actually involved (e.g., specimen, facilities, equipment). The Observation.value is the value actually obtained (e.g., 80 mg/dL, or &lt;15 mg/dL).</p><p>In event-CRITERION mood, an author considers a certain class of "obtaining blood glucose" possibly with a certain value (range) as outcome. The Participations constrain the criterion, for instance, to a particular patient. The Observation.value is the range in which the criterion would hold (e.g. &gt; 180 mg/dL or 200-300 mg/dL).</p><p>In GOAL mood (a kind of criterion), the author states that "our goal is to be able to obtain blood glucose with the given value (range)". The Participations are similar to intents, especially the author of the goal and the patient for whom the goal is made. The Observation.value is the range which defined when the goal is met (e.g. 80-120 mg/dl).</p><p><i>Rationale:</i> The notion of "mood" is borrowed from natural language grammar, the mood of a verb (lat. modus verbi). </p><p>The notion of mood also resembles the various extensions of the logic of facts in modal logic and logic with modalities, where the moodCode specifies the modality (fact, possibility, intention, goal, etc.) under which the Act-statement is judged as appropriate or defective.</p></text></definition></annotations><type name="CS"/><supplierDomainSpecification domainName="ActMood" codingStrength="CNE"/></attribute><attribute name="id" sortKey="3" minimumMultiplicity="0" maximumMultiplicity="*" isMandatory="false"><annotations><definition><text><p>A unique identifier for the Act.</p></text></definition><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| PID^18^00121^Patient Account Number |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| MRG^3^00213^Prior Patient Account Number |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| BLG^3^00236^Account ID |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| FT1^2^00356^Transaction ID |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| FT1^14^00368^Insurance Plan ID |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN1^2^00368^Insurance Plan ID |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| DG1^8^00382^Diagnostic Related Group |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| DRG^1^00382^Diagnostic Related Group |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN1^14^00439^Authorization Information |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN1^35^00460^Company Plan Code |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN1^46^00471^Prior Insurance Plan ID |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN3^2^00503^Certification Number |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| UB2^12^00564^Document Control Number |</text></mapping></annotations><type name="SET"><supplierBindingArgumentDatatype name="II"/></type></attribute><attribute name="code" sortKey="4" minimumMultiplicity="0" maximumMultiplicity="1" isMandatory="false"><annotations><definition><text><p>A code specifying the particular kind of Act that the Act-instance represents within its class.</p><p><i>Constraints:</i> The kind of Act (e.g. physical examination, serum potassium, inpatient encounter, charge financial transaction, etc.) is specified with a code from one of several, typically external, coding systems. The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc.</p><p>Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure.</p><p>Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code "potassium" together with and Act.classCode for "laboratory observation" to somehow mean "potassium laboratory observation" and then use the same Act.code for "potassium" together with Act.classCode for "medication" to mean "substitution of potassium". This mutually modifying use of Act.code and Act.classCode is not permitted.</p><p><i>Discussion:</i> Act.code is not a required attribute of Act. Rather than naming the kind of Act using an Act.code, one can specify the Act using only the class code and other attributes and properties of the Act. In general and more commonly, the kind of Act is readily specified by an ActRelationship specifying that this Act instantiates another Act in definition mood. Or, even without reference to an act definition, the act may be readily described by other attributes, ActRelationships and Participations. For example, the kind of SubstanceAdministration may be readily described by referring to the specific drug, as the Participation of an Entity representing that drug.</p></text></definition><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| FT1^18^00148^Patient Type |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| PV1^18^00148^Patient Type |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN1^15^00440^Plan Type |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN1^31^00456^Type of Agreement Code |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN2^21^00492^Blood Deductible |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN2^28^00499^Room Coverage Type/Amount |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN2^29^00500^Policy Type/Amount |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN2^30^00501^Daily Deductible |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN3^12^00513^Non-Concur Code/Description |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| DRG^8^00770^DRG Payor |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN1^47^01227^Coverage Type |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| LRL^4^01227^Coverage Type |</text></mapping></annotations><type name="CD"/><supplierDomainSpecification domainName="ActCode" codingStrength="CWE"/></attribute><attribute name="negationInd" sortKey="5" isStructural="true" minimumMultiplicity="0" maximumMultiplicity="1" isMandatory="false"><annotations><definition><text><p>An indicator specifying that the Act statement is a negation of the Act as described by the descriptive attributes.</p><p><i>Examples:</i> Used with an Observation event, it allows one to say "patient has NO chest pain". With an Observation criterion it negates the criterion analogously, e.g., "if patient has NO chest pain for 3 days ...", or "if systolic blood pressure is <b>not</b> within 90-100 mm Hg ..."</p><p><i>Discussion:</i> The negationInd works as a negative existence quantifier. This is best explained on Acts in criterion mood, and then translates into all other moods. In criterion mood without negation, one usually only specifies a few critical attributes and relationships (features) of an Act, i.e., only those that are needed to test the criterion. The more features one specifies, the more constrained (specific) is the criterion. For example, to test for "systolic blood pressure of 90-100 mm Hg", one would use only the descriptive attributes Act.code (for systolic blood pressure) and Observation.value (for 90-100 mm Hg). If one would also specify an effectiveTime, i.e., for "yesterday", the criterion would be more constrained. If the negationInd is true for the above criterion, then the meaning of the test is whether a systolic blood pressure of 90-100 mm Hg yesterday does <b>not exist</b> (independent of whether any blood pressure was measured).</p><p>The negationInd negates the Act as described by the descriptive properties (including Act.code, Act.effectiveTime, Observation.value, Act.doseQty, etc.) and any of its components. The inert properties such as Act.id, Act.moodCode, Act.confidentialityCode, and particularly the Author-Participation are <b>not</b> negated. These inert properties always have the same meaning: i.e., the author remains to be the author of the negative observation. Also, most ActRelationships (except for components) are not included in the negation. </p><p>For example, a highly confidential order written by Dr. Jones, to explicitly <b>not</b> give "succinyl choline" for the "reason" (ActRelationship) of a history of malignant hyperthermia (Observation) negates the descriptive properties "give succinyl choline" (Act.code), but it is still positively an order and written by Dr. Jones and for patient John Smith, and the reason for this order is the patient's history of malignant hyperthermia. </p><p>However, additional detail in descriptive attributes will be part of the negation which then limits the effectiveness of the negated statement. For example, had the order not to give a substance included a doseQuantity, it would mean that the substance should not be given at that particular dose (but any other dose might still be O.K.).</p><p>An act statement with negationInd is still a statement about the specific fact described by the Act. For instance, a negated "finding of wheezing on July 1" means that the author positively denies that there was wheezing on July 1, and that he takes the same responsibility for such statement and the same requirement to have evidence for such statement than if he had not used negation. Conversely, negation indicator does <b>not</b> just negate that the fact was affirmed or that the statement had been made. This holds for all moods in the same way, e.g., a negated order is an order <b>not</b> to do the described act, not just the lapidary statement that there is no such order.</p></text></definition></annotations><type name="BL"/></attribute><attribute name="derivationExpr" sortKey="6" minimumMultiplicity="0" maximumMultiplicity="1" isMandatory="false"><annotations><definition><text><p>A character string containing a formal language expression that specifies how the Act's attributes are (should be or have been) derived from input parameters associated with derivation relationships.</p><p><i>Discussion:</i> Derived observations can be defined through association with other observations using ActRelationships of type "derivation". For example, to define a derived observation for Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) one will associate the MCH observation with a Hemoglobin (HGB) observation and a Red Blood cell Count (RBC) observation.

The clinically relevant time is the effectiveTime. When an observation of a prior symptom is made, the activityTime describes the time the observation is made, as opposed to effectiveTime which is the time the symptom occurred. Thus the activityTime may be entirely different than the effectiveTime of the same Act. But even apart from clinical use cases, designers should first consider effectiveTime as the primary relevant time for an Act.</p><p>The activityTime is a descriptive attribute, i.e., like effectiveTime, it always describes the Act event as it does or would occur, even when working with different moods. For example, when a procedure is requested, the activityTime describes the requested total time of the procedure. By contrast, the author Participation.time is inert, i.e., author participation time on an order specifies when the order was written and has nothing to do with when the event might actually occur.</p><p>ActivityTime indicates when an Act occurs, not when an Act is recorded. Many applications track the time an observation is recorded rather than the precise time during which an observation is made, in which case Participation.time (e.g. of the Author) should be used. These recorded observations can take place during an encounter, and the time of the encounter often provides enough information so that activityTime isn't clinically relevant.</p></text></definition><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| FT1^4^00358^Transaction Date |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN1^29^00454^Verification Date/Time |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN3^7^00508^Certification Modify Date/Time |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| DRG^2^00769^DRG Assigned Date/Time |</text></mapping></annotations><type name="GTS"/></attribute><attribute name="availabilityTime" sortKey="12" minimumMultiplicity="0" maximumMultiplicity="1" isMandatory="false"><annotations><definition><text><p>The point in time at which information about Act-instance (regardless of mood) first became available to a system reproducing this Act. </p><p><i>Examples:</i> An Act might record that a patient had a right-ventricular myocardial infarction effective three hours ago (see Act.effectiveTime), but we may only know about this unusual condition a few minutes ago (Act.availabilityTime).

There are two important problems with per-item confidentiality: one is inference and the other is the danger of holding back information that may be critical in a certain care situation. Inference means that filtered sensitive information can still be assumed given the other information that was not filtered. The simplest form of inference is that even the existence of a test order for an HIV Western Blot test or a T4/T8 lymphocyte count is a strong indication for an existing HIV infection, even if the results are not known. Very often, diagnoses can be inferred from medication, such as Zidovudin for treatment of HIV infections. The problem of hiding individual items becomes especially difficult with current medications, since the continuing administration of the medication must be assured.</p><p>To mitigate some of the inference-risk, aggregations of data should assume the confidentiality level of the most confidential action in the aggregation.</p></text></definition><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN1^27^00452^Release Information Code |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| PV2^21^00722^Visit Publicity Code |</text></mapping></annotations><type name="SET"><supplierBindingArgumentDatatype name="CE"/></type><supplierDomainSpecification domainName="Confidentiality" codingStrength="CWE"/></attribute><attribute name="repeatNumber" sortKey="15" minimumMultiplicity="0" maximumMultiplicity="1" isMandatory="false"><annotations><definition><text><p>An interval of integer numbers stating the minimal and maximal number of repetitions of the Act.</p><p><i>Examples:</i> An oral surgeon's advice to a patient after tooth extraction might be: "replace the gauze every hour for 1 to 3 times until bleeding has stopped completely."

The meaning and purpose of an ActRelationship is specified in the ActRelationship.typeCode attribute. </p><p><i>Examples:</i> 1) An electrolyte observation panel may have sodium, potassium, pH, and bicarbonate observations as components.

The procedure has an outbound ActRelationship of type "has reason" to the cholelithiasis observation.</p><p><i>Discussion:</i> Consider every ActRelationship instance an arrow with a point (headed to the target) and a butt (coming from the source). The functions (sometimes called "roles") that source and target Acts play in that association are defined for each ActRelationship type differently. For instance in a composition relationship, the source is the composite and the target is the component. In a reason-relationship the source is any Act and the target is the reason or indication for the source-Act.</p><p>The relationships associated with an Act are considered properties of the source act object. This means that the author of an Act-instance is also considered the author of all of the act relationships that have this Act as their source. There are no exceptions to this rule.</p><p>See ActRelationship.typeCode for more overview of the different kinds of ActRelationships.</p><p>The ActRelationship class is used to construct action plans and to represent clinical reasoning or judgments about action relationships. Prior actions can be linked as the reasons for more recent actions. Supporting evidence can be linked with current clinical hypotheses. Problem lists and other networks of related judgments about clinical events are represented by the ActRelationship link.</p><p>One of the most commonly used ActRelationship types is "has component" to describe the composition and de-composition of Acts. The relationship type allows specifying detail of Acts to varying degrees.</p><p>The composition relationship can group actions into "batteries," e.g., LYTES, CHEM12, or CBC, where multiple routine laboratory tests are ordered as a group. Some groupings, such as CHEM12, appear more arbitrary; others, such as blood pressure, seem to naturally consist of systolic and diastolic pressure.</p><p>The composition relationships can be arranged in a sequence to form temporal and conditional (non-temporal) action plans (e.g., care plan, critical path, clinical trials protocol, drug treatment protocols). There is a group of attributes in both Act and ActRelationship that we refer to as the "workflow Control suite of attributes", and which allow the detailed specification of executable action plans. These attributes are:</p><p>ActRelationship.sequenceNumber arranges the components of an Act as a sequence or as concurrent collections of components, expressing logical branches as well as parallel tasks (tasks carried out at the same time). The ActRelationship attributes splitCode and joinCode control how branches are selected or executable in parallel.</p><p>Act.activityTime and ActRelationship.pauseQty allow one to explicitly time an action plan. Act.repeatNumber allows specifying act to repeat (loop).</p><p>The ActRelationship type has-precondition allows plan steps to be conditional on the status or outcome of previous actions. The ActRelationhsip.checkpointCode specifies when pre-conditions of acts are tested during the flow of control.</p><p>The composition ActRelationship allows these constructs to be organized in multiple layers of nesting to fully support workflow management. This nesting and the workflow control attributes are designed in analogy to a block-structured programming language with support for concurrency (fork, join, interrupts), and without "goto" statements. It is important to note that ALL plans are established through sequencing components (steps) in a composite act (block) as can be depicted in "Nassi-Schneiderman" diagrams (also known as "Chap Charts" or "Structograms"), not by chain-linking acts as in a flowchart diagram. </p><p>With the composition relationship, the detail of Acts can be revealed to different levels for different purposes, without the structure of the Act hierarchy needing to be rearranged. This allows supporting multiple viewpoints on the same business processes. For instance, a billing-viewpoint of a laboratory test battery may be as a single billable act. A clinician's view of the same laboratory test battery is as a set of individual observations, where the ordering among the observations is irrelevant. The laboratory's view of this act will be more detailed, including action plan steps that are never reported to the clinician (e.g., centrifugation, decantation, aliquoting, running certain machines etc.). The laboratory's viewpoint warrants a thorough specification of action plans (that can be automated). During this specification, more and more nested sub-activities will be defined. Still the Act is the same, with varying degrees of detail uncovered in the de-composition relationship. </p><p>We described the nature of varying detail saying that Acts are "fractal", ever more decomposable, just as the movements of a robotic arm can be decomposed in many fine control steps.</p></text></definition></annotations><stewardCommittee id="C04" name="Orders_observations"/><stewardCommittee id="C12" name="Patient_care"/><attribute name="typeCode" sortKey="1" isStructural="true" minimumMultiplicity="1" maximumMultiplicity="1" isMandatory="true"><annotations><definition><text><p>A code specifying the meaning and purpose of every ActRelationship instance.

For example, when reading a report taken from a folder containing a patient's medical record, the reader will infer that the report deals with the patient, even if there is no direct reference to the patient on the form. However, other pieces of information such as the author of the folder (the hospital that maintains it) may sometimes apply to the contents of the folder (e.g. a report generated by a doctor at the hospital) and other times not (e.g. a copy of a report from another institution). Humans are quite good at making the necessary inferences about what context should be propagated from an item to something within that item. However, incorrect inferences can occur (perhaps the report in the patient's record deals with a relative). Furthermore, computers have substantially more difficulty making such inferences, even though they can be essential for decision-support systems.</p><p><i>Discussion:</i> This attribute allows the clear specification of whether an association adds to the context associated with a particular item (e.g. adding an additional author) or whether it replaces (overrides) part of the context associated with a particular item (e.g. identifying a sole author, independent of the containing item).

For example, an author participation might be marked as propagating, but still not conducted to a hyperlink to an external document.</p><p>If no value or default is specified for this attribute (i.e. it is null), no inference can be made about context. Systems must make their own assumptions on the basis of what data is being represented. (For this reason, HL7 committees are encouraged to specify a default or fixed value for this attribute as part of their designs to ensure consistency of interpretation.)</p><p><i>Examples:</i> An observation event has a patient participation marked "additive, propagating" (AP) and has component observation events linked through act relationships that are marked propagating.

The order further has a relationship to a dispense event, marked as conductive, and an association to a drug protocol marked as non-conductive (contextConductionInd is FALSE). The meaning would be as follows:</p><p>The pharmacy order is interpreted as having the patient from the composite order, and having two authors (the one from the composite order, and the one on the pharmacy order itself). The diagnosis for the pharmacy order would <b>only</b> be the diagnosis specified on the pharmacy order, not the one specified on the composite order.

When the condition holds true, the next repetition is ready for execution. </p><p>When the checkpointCode is "entry" the criterion is checked at the beginning of each repetition (if any) whereas "beginning" means the criterion is checked only once before the repetition "loop" starts.</p><p>The checkpointCode "through" is special in that it requires the condition to hold throughout the execution of the Act, even throughout a single execution. As soon as the condition turns false, the Act should receive an interrupt event (see Act.interruptibleInd) and will eventually terminate.</p><p>The checkpointCode "exit" is only used on a special plan step that represents a loop exit step. This allows an action plan to exit due to a condition tested inside the execution of this plan. Such exit criteria are sequenced with the other plan components using the ActRelationship.sequenceNumber.</p></text></definition></annotations><type name="CS"/><supplierDomainSpecification domainName="ActRelationshipCheckpoint" codingStrength="CNE"/></attribute><attribute name="splitCode" sortKey="9" minimumMultiplicity="0" maximumMultiplicity="1" isMandatory="false"><annotations><definition><text><p>A code specifying how branches in an action plan are selected among other branches.</p><p><i>Discussion:</i> This attribute is part of the workflow control suite of attributes.

Each Entity (in a Role) involved in an Act in a certain way is linked to the act by one Participation-instance. The kind of involvement in the Act is specified by the Participation.typeCode.</p><p><i>Examples:</i> 1) Performers of acts (surgeons, observers, practitioners).</p><p>2) Subjects of acts, patient, devices</p><p>3) Locations</p><p>4) Author, co-signer, witness, informant</p><p>5) Addressee, information recipient</p><p><i>Rationale:</i> Participations represent performance while Roles represent competence. Participations specify the actual performance of an Entity in a certain Act, and thus a Participation is scoped by its specific Act. Conversely, Roles specify the competence of an Entity (i.e., how it may principally participate in what kinds of acts) irrespective of any individual Act.</p><p>For example, the professional credentials of a person (Role) may be quite different from what a person actually does (Participation). A common example is interns and residents performing anesthesia or surgeries under (more or less) supervision of attending specialists. </p><p>An Act can have multiple participations of the same type, which indicates collaborative activities or group involvement. The notion of multiple performing Participations partially overlaps with sub-activities (Act components). Whenever multiple actors are involved in an act, each actor performs a different task (with the extremely rare exception of such symmetrical activities as two people pulling a rope from either end). Thus, the presence of multiple actors could be equally well represented as an act consisting of sub-acts where each act would have only one performing actor </p><p>For example, a record of a surgical service may include the actors of type: (a) consenter, (b) primary surgeon, and (c) anesthetist. These three actors really perform different tasks, which can be represented as three related acts: (a) the consent, (b) the surgery proper, and (c) the anesthesia act in parallel to the surgery. If we used the sub-acts, the consenter, surgeon and anesthetist could simply be of actor type "performer." Thus the more sub-acts we use, the fewer different actor types we need to distinguish; conversely, the fewer sub-acts we use, the more distinct actor types we need.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, sub-tasks should be considered instead of multiple actors when each sub-task requires special scheduling, or billing, or if overall responsibilities for the sub-tasks are different. In most cases, however, human resources are scheduled by teams (instead of individuals), billing tends to lump many sub-tasks together into one position, and overall responsibility often rests with one attending physician, chief nurse, or head of department. This model allows both the multi-actor and the multi-act approach to represent the business reality, with a slight bias towards "lumping" minor sub-activities into the overall act.</p></text></definition></annotations><stewardCommittee id="C04" name="Orders_observations"/><stewardCommittee id="C12" name="Patient_care"/><attribute name="typeCode" sortKey="1" isStructural="true" minimumMultiplicity="1" maximumMultiplicity="1" isMandatory="true"><annotations><definition><text><p>A code specifying the kind of Participation or involvement the Entity playing the Role associated with the Participation has with regard to the associated Act.</p><p><i>Constraints:</i> The Participant.typeCode contains only categories that have crisp semantic relevance in the scope of HL7.

The main difference between observations and other acts is that it has a value attribute that is used to state the result of the assessment action described in Act.code.</p><p><i>Discussion:</i> Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a "variable" (a named feature that can assume a value); hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter. </p><p>As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed ("results" or "answers"); and those "results" or "answers" are part of the observation and not split off into other objects. </p><p>The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.</p><p>An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations. </p><p>Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC. </p><p>Clinical documents commonly have 'Subjective' and 'Objective' findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain 'Assessments', which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation. </p><p>The Observation.code (or the reference to the Observation definition) specifies the kind of diagnosis (e.g. "chief complaint" or "discharge diagnosis") and the value specifies the diagnosis code or symptom code. </p><p><i>Examples of Observation:</i></p></text></definition></annotations><stewardCommittee id="C04" name="Orders_observations"/><interestedCommittee id="C12" name="Patient_care"/><attribute name="value" sortKey="1" minimumMultiplicity="0" maximumMultiplicity="*" isMandatory="false"><annotations><definition><text><p>Information that is assigned or determined by the observation action. </p><p><i>Constraints:</i> The Observation.value, if not otherwise constrained, can be of any data type.</p><p>The appropriate data type of the Observation.value varies with the kind of Observation and can generally be described in Observation definitions or in a simple relation that pairs Act.codes to value data types.</p><p>The following guidelines govern the choice of the appropriate value data type.</p><p>(1) Quantitative measurements use the data type Physical Quantity (PQ) in general. A PQ is essentially a real number with a unit. This is the general preference for all numeric values, subject to a few exceptions listed below. </p><p>Numeric values <b>must not</b> be communicated as simply a character string (ST). </p><p>(2) Titer (e.g., 1:64) and very few other ratios use the data type Ratio (RTO). For titers, the ratio would be a ratio of two integer numbers (e.g., 1:128). Other ratios may relate different quantitative data types, such as a "price" specified in Physical Quantity over Monetary Amount.</p><p>Sometimes by local conventions titers are reported as just the denominator (e.g., 32 instead of 1/32). Such conventions are confusing and <b>should</b> be converted into correct ratios in HL7 messages. </p><p>(3) Index values (a number without unit) uses the Real Number (REAL) data type. When a quantity does not have a proper unit, one can just send the number as a real number. Alternatively one can use a PQ with a dimensionless unit (e.g., 1 or %). An integer number should only be sent when the measurement is by definition an integer, which is an extremely rare case and then is most likely an ordinal (see below).</p><p>(4) Ranges (e.g., &lt;3; 12-20) must be expressed as Interval of Physical Quantity (IVL&lt;PQ&gt;) or intervals of other quantity data types.</p><p>Sometimes such intervals are used to report the uncertainty of measurement value. For uncertainty there are dedicated data type extensions available. </p><p>(5) Ordinals (e.g., +, ++, +++; or I, IIa, IIb, III, IV) use the Coded Ordinal (CO) data type. </p><p>(6) Nominal results ("taxons", e.g., organism type). use any of the coded data types (CD, CE) that specify at least a code and a coding system, and optionally original text, translations to other coding systems and sometimes qualifiers. </p><p>(7) Imaging results use the Encapsulated Data (ED) type. The encapsulated data type allows one to send an image (e.g., chest X-ray) or a movie (e.g., coronary angiography, cardiac echo) as alternatively inline binary data or as a reference to an external address where the data can be downloaded on demand.</p><p>(8) Waveforms can be sent using the Correlated Observation Sequences templates that provide all the data in an HL7 framework. In addition one can use the Encapsulated Data (ED) data type to send waveforms in other than HL7 formats or to refer to waveform data for on-demand download. </p><p>(9) The character string data type may exceptionally be used to convey formalized expressions that do not fit in any of the existing data types. However, the string data type <b>must not</b> be used if the meaning can be represented by one of the existing data types. </p><p>(10) Timestamps <b>should not</b> be sent in Observations if there are more appropriate places to send those, e.g., usually as Act.effectiveTime of some act. (E.g., "specimen received in lab" is in the effectiveTime of an Act describing the specimen transport to the lab, not in an Observation.</p><p>(11) Sets of values of any data type, enumerated sets as well as intervals, are often used for Observation criteria (event-criterion mood) to specify "normal ranges" or "decision ranges" (for alerts) etc.</p><p>(12) For sequences of observations (repeated measurements of the same property during a relatively short time) a Sequence (LIST) data type is used. Refer to the Correlated Observation Sequences specification for more detail.</p><p>(13) Uncertainty of values is specified using the Probability and Probability Distribution data type extensions (UVP, PPD). If a statistical sample is reported with absolute frequencies of categories a Bag collection (BAG) can be used efficiently.</p></text></definition><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| GT1^34^00145^Ambulatory Status |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN2^32^00145^Ambulatory Status |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| NK1^18^00145^Ambulatory Status |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| PV1^15^00145^Ambulatory Status |</text></mapping></annotations><type name="ANY"/><supplierDomainSpecification domainName="ObservationValue" codingStrength="CWE"/></attribute><attribute name="interpretationCode" sortKey="2" minimumMultiplicity="0" maximumMultiplicity="*" isMandatory="false"><annotations><definition><text><p>One or more codes specifying a rough qualitative interpretation of the observation, such as "normal", "abnormal", "below normal", "change up", "resistant", "susceptible", etc.</p><p><i>Discussion:</i> These interpretation codes are sometimes called "abnormal flags", however, the judgment of normalcy is just one of the common rough interpretations, and is often not relevant.

Procedure does not subsume those other activities nor is procedure subsumed by them. Notably Procedure does not comprise all acts of whose intent is intervention or treatment. Whether the bodily alteration is appreciated or intended as beneficial to the subject is likewise irrelevant, what counts is that the act is essentially an alteration of the physical condition of the subject.</p><p>The choice between representations for real activities is based on whether the specific properties of procedure are applicable and whether the activity or activity step's necessary post-condition is the physical alteration.

There are two important problems with per-item confidentiality: one is inference and the other is the danger of holding back information that may be critical in a certain care situation. Inference means that filtered sensitive information can still be assumed given the other information that was not filtered. The simplest form of inference is that even the existence of a test order for an HIV Western Blot test or a T4/T8 lymphocyte count is a strong indication for an existing HIV infection, even if the results are not known. Very often, diagnoses can be inferred from medication, such as Zidovudin for treatment of HIV infections. The problem of hiding individual items becomes especially difficult with current medications, since the continuing administration of the medication must be assured.</p><p>To mitigate some of the inference-risk, aggregations of data should assume the confidentiality level of the most confidential action in the aggregation.</p></text></definition><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| GT1^38^00743^Publicity Indicator |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN2^36^00743^Publicity Indicator |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| NK1^22^00743^Publicity Indicator |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| PD1^11^00743^Publicity Indicator |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| GT1^39^00744^Protection Indicator |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| IN2^37^00744^Protection Indicator |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| NK1^23^00744^Protection Indicator |</text></mapping><mapping sourceName="HL7v2" sourceVersion="2.3"><text>| PD1^12^00744^Protection Indicator |</text></mapping></annotations><type name="SET"><supplierBindingArgumentDatatype name="CE"/></type><supplierDomainSpecification domainName="Confidentiality" codingStrength="CWE"/></attribute><attribute name="quantity" sortKey="12" minimumMultiplicity="0" maximumMultiplicity="1" isMandatory="false"><annotations><definition><text><p>A ratio (numerator : denominator) specifying the relative quantities of the Entity playing the Role in the Entity scoping the Role, used for Roles that represent composition relationships between the scoping and playing Entities.</p><p><i>Examples:</i> 1.)

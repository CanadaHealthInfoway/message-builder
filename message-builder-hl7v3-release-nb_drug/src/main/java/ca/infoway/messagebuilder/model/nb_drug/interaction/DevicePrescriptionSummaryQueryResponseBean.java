 * /devicePrescription&rdquo;. They must be cached locally by 
 * the POS system with the associated records, and used as the 
 * identifier for all interactions with the HIAL that require a 
 * device prescription identifier.</p> <p>In the returned 
 * response, any number of &ldquo;subject&rdquo; elements 
 * containing device prescriptions may be returned and any 
 * number of &ldquo;subjectOf&rdquo; elements containing 
 * relevant issues across the returned device prescriptions may 
 * also be returned. If the returned issue contains a 
 * &ldquo;mitigatedBy&rdquo; element, the issue is considered 
 * managed.</p>

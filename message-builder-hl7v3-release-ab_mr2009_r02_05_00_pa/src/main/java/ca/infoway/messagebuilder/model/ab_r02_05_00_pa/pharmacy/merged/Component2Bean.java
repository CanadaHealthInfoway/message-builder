 * to accommodate circumstances where multiple drug products 
 * may need to be dispensed to complete a therapy. E.g. 100 x 
 * 20mg tablets and 50 x 10mg tablets. The association is 
 * marked as Populated because the authorization to dispense is 
 * a critical portion of a prescription. However the 
 * association is allowed to be 'null' when the order is for a 
 * medication which requires no dispense authorization (e.g. 
 * over-the-counter medications), or when the patient already 
 * has sufficient supply of the medication on hand to complete 
 * the therapy.</p>

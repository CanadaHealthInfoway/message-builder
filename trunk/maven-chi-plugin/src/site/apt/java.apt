                         ---------------------------


Java Class Generation

  One of the code generation tools is a tool to read a generated message set and create
  Java code that can be used to populate and model the HL7 XML messages.
  
Overview
  
  The xml-to-java tool reads in a message set, performs simplification on the message
  parts, and then generates Java classes that can be used to marshall HL7 messages.

Maven Configuration

  The xml-to-java generator is run using Maven.  A typical configuration 
  looks like this:

+----
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>ca.infoway.messagebuilder</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-chi-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.0b2-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <configuration>
          <messageSet>./path/to/messageSet.xml</messageSet>
          <basePackageName>ca.infoway.messagebuilder.model</basePackageName>
          <javaSourceFolder>./src/main/java</javaSourceFolder>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
+----

  To execute the generator, type the following command:
  
+----
  mvn chi:xml-to-java

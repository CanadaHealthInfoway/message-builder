 * <p>PRPM_MT303010CA.ServiceDeliveryLocation: Service Delivery 
 * Location</p>
 * 
 * <p><p>A role played by a place at which services may be 
 * provided. The RIM defines two specializations of service 
 * delivery location: 1. incidental service delivery location - 
 * A role played by a place at which health care services may 
 * be provided without prior designation or authorization and 
 * 2. dedicated service delivery location - A role played by a 
 * place that is intended to house the provision of services. 
 * Scoper is the Entity (typically Organization) that provides 
 * these services. This is not synonymous with 
 * &quot;ownership&quot;. This can be further characterized by 
 * a role code of: A)DedicatedClinicalLocationRoleType - A role 
 * of a place that further classifies the clinical setting 
 * (e.g., cardiology clinic, primary care clinic, 
 * rehabilitation hospital, skilled nursing facility) in which 
 * care is delivered during an encounter or 
 * B)DedicatedNonClinicalLocationRoleType - A role of a place 
 * that further classifies the setting in which non-clinical 
 * services are delivered. A given physical place can play 
 * multiple service delivery location roles each with its own 
 * attributes. For example, a Podiatric clinic and Research 
 * clinic may meet on alternate days in the same physical 
 * location; each clinic uses its own mailing address and

 * during the course of care to describe the progress of care 
 * or may be sent at the termination of care to describe all 
 * the activities that occurred during the provision of care. 
 * Note that this record merely captures the existence of care 
 * and the locations and people involved. The actual discrete 
 * events and any care summary documentation that results are 
 * captured using other messages.</p><p>Examples include:
